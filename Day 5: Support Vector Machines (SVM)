ðŸš€ Day 5: Support Vector Machines (SVM) â€“ Drawing the Optimal Boundary
Welcome to Day 5 of #30DaysOfMLAlgorithms! Today, weâ€™re diving into Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful and versatile algorithm for classification, regression, and outlier detection tasks.

Key Concepts
Support Vector Machines work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points into different classes.

Key Idea: Maximize the margin between data points of different classes.
The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points (called support vectors).
Kernel Trick: SVMs can handle non-linear data by transforming it into higher dimensions using kernels (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF).
Works for both binary and multiclass classification tasks.

Real-World Applications
Healthcare: Classifying tumors as malignant or benign.
Finance: Detecting fraudulent transactions.
Text Classification: Spam detection and sentiment analysis.
Image Recognition: Face detection and handwriting recognition.
Bioinformatics: Identifying genes linked to specific diseases.

Pros and Cons
Pros:

Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
Works well with small datasets.
Can handle non-linear relationships using kernels.
Robust to overfitting with proper regularization.

Cons:

Computationally intensive for large datasets.
Sensitive to hyperparameter tuning (e.g., kernel choice, regularization).
Less interpretable compared to simpler models.

Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s an example of using SVM in Python with scikit-learn:

# Import libraries  
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification  
from sklearn.svm import SVC  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report  

# Generate synthetic data  
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=500, n_features=2, n_classes=2, n_informative=2, random_state=42)  

# Split data  
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)  

# Train SVM with RBF kernel  
model = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1, gamma=0.5)  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  

# Predict and evaluate  
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)  
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")  
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))  

# Visualize decision boundary  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import numpy as np  

# Create grid for visualization  
x_min, x_max = X[:, 0].min() - 1, X[:, 0].max() + 1  
y_min, y_max = X[:, 1].min() - 1, X[:, 1].max() + 1  
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, 0.01), np.arange(y_min, y_max, 0.01))  

# Predict on grid  
Z = model.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()]).reshape(xx.shape)  

# Plot  
plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.8, cmap='coolwarm')  
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, edgecolors='k', cmap='coolwarm')  
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')  
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')  
plt.title('SVM Decision Boundary')  
plt.show()  

Key Takeaway
Support Vector Machines are highly effective for classification and regression tasks, especially when the data has a clear margin of separation. With proper tuning, they can excel in complex, non-linear problems using kernel transformations.

Whatâ€™s Next?
Stay tuned for Day 6, where weâ€™ll explore Naive Bayes, a probabilistic algorithm widely used for text classification and other applications!
