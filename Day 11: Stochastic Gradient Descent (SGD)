ðŸš€ Day 11: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) â€“ Optimization Made Scalable
Welcome to Day 11 of #30DaysOfMLAlgorithms! Today, weâ€™re exploring Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a variant of Gradient Descent designed for scalability and efficiency in large datasets.

Key Concepts
Stochastic Gradient Descent updates model parameters for each training example, rather than the entire dataset, making it faster and more suitable for big data.

How It Works:

Random Sampling: At each iteration, pick one training example (or a small batch) at random.
Compute Gradient: Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters for that example.
Update Parameters: Adjust the parameters using the gradient and learning rate.

â€‹Difference from Gradient Descent:

Standard Gradient Descent uses the entire dataset for each update, while SGD uses one example (or a small batch), introducing some noise but improving speed and convergence in practice.

Real-World Applications
Deep Learning: Training neural networks with large datasets efficiently.
Recommender Systems: Optimizing collaborative filtering algorithms.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Training models for text generation or sentiment analysis.
Logistic Regression: Efficiently finding optimal parameters.
Reinforcement Learning: Updating policies in real-time as new data arrives.

Pros and Cons
Pros:

Scales well for large datasets.
Faster updates lead to quicker iterations.
Introduces randomness, helping escape local minima or saddle points.

Cons:

High variance in updates can cause instability.
Sensitive to learning rate; improper tuning can hinder convergence.
Requires more iterations to converge compared to batch methods.

Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s how you can implement SGD in Python for a simple linear regression problem:

import numpy as np  

# Example Dataset  
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  
y = np.array([2.2, 2.8, 4.5, 3.7, 5.5])  

# Parameters  
m = 0  # Initial slope  
b = 0  # Initial intercept  
alpha = 0.01  # Learning rate  
epochs = 100  # Number of iterations  

# SGD Implementation  
for _ in range(epochs):  
    for i in range(len(X)):  
        # Pick one data point  
        xi = X[i]  
        yi = y[i]  

        # Compute gradient for this point  
        y_pred = m * xi + b  
        error = y_pred - yi  
        dm = 2 * error * xi  
        db = 2 * error  

        # Update parameters  
        m -= alpha * dm  
        b -= alpha * db  

print(f"Slope (m): {m}, Intercept (b): {b}")  

# Visualize Results  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Data')  
plt.plot(X, m * X + b, color='red', label='Regression Line')  
plt.legend()  
plt.title('Stochastic Gradient Descent in Action')  
plt.show()  

Key Takeaway
Stochastic Gradient Descent is a workhorse of modern machine learning, enabling fast and efficient optimization for large-scale problems. Though it introduces randomness, careful tuning can lead to powerful results.
