ðŸš€ Day 10: Gradient Descent â€“ The Backbone of Optimization
Welcome to Day 10 of #30DaysOfMLAlgorithms! Today, weâ€™re diving into Gradient Descent, the core optimization algorithm that powers many machine learning models.

Key Concepts
Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost function by adjusting model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent.

How It Works:

Initialization: Start with random values for the parameters.
Compute Gradient: Calculate the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each parameter.
Update Parameters: Adjust the parameters by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient, scaled by a learning rate.

â€‹Repeat: Continue until convergence (i.e., when updates become very small).
Variants of Gradient Descent:

Batch Gradient Descent: Uses the entire dataset for each step.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Updates parameters using one data point at a time.
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: Combines the efficiency of batch and stochastic by using small data batches.

Real-World Applications
Training Neural Networks: Optimizing weights and biases in deep learning models.
Regression Models: Minimizing the cost function in linear or logistic regression.
Clustering: Used in algorithms like K-Means for centroid updates.
Recommender Systems: Fine-tuning models to predict user preferences.
Computer Vision: Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks.

Pros and Cons
Pros:

Scales well to high-dimensional datasets.
Efficient for large machine learning problems.
Versatile and used across a wide range of models.

Cons:

Sensitive to the choice of learning rate.
Can get stuck in local minima or saddle points.
Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters like batch size and learning rate schedule.

Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s how you can implement Gradient Descent in Python for a simple linear regression problem:

import numpy as np  

# Example Dataset  
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  
y = np.array([2.2, 2.8, 4.5, 3.7, 5.5])  

# Parameters  
m = 0  # Initial slope  
b = 0  # Initial intercept  
alpha = 0.01  # Learning rate  
epochs = 1000  # Number of iterations  

# Gradient Descent Implementation  
for _ in range(epochs):  
    y_pred = m * X + b  # Predicted values  
    error = y_pred - y  # Error  

    # Gradients  
    dm = (2 / len(X)) * np.sum(error * X)  
    db = (2 / len(X)) * np.sum(error)  

    # Update parameters  
    m -= alpha * dm  
    b -= alpha * db  

print(f"Slope (m): {m}, Intercept (b): {b}")  

# Visualize Results  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Data')  
plt.plot(X, m * X + b, color='red', label='Regression Line')  
plt.legend()  
plt.title('Gradient Descent in Action')  
plt.show()  
Key Takeaway
Gradient Descent is the driving force behind many machine learning models, allowing them to learn and improve. Its flexibility and efficiency make it indispensable, but tuning parameters like the learning rate is key to success.
