ðŸš€ Day 1: Linear Regression â€“ Simplifying Predictions
Welcome to Day 1 of #31DaysOfMLAlgorithms! Today, weâ€™re starting with the foundation of supervised learning: Linear Regression.

Key Concepts
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (output) and one or more independent variables (inputs). The goal is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.

Key Assumptions:

Linear relationship between variables.
Homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors).
Independence of errors.
Normal distribution of errors.
Real-World Applications
Predicting Sales: Estimating future sales based on marketing spend.
Healthcare: Modeling patient outcomes based on diagnostic tests.
Finance: Predicting stock prices or economic trends.
Real Estate: Estimating house prices based on location, size, and other factors.
Pros and Cons
Pros:

Simple to implement and interpret.
Works well for small datasets with linear relationships.
Computationally efficient.
Cons:

Assumes linear relationships, limiting its applicability.
Sensitive to outliers.
Can underperform with complex or non-linear data.
Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a quick Python implementation using scikit-learn:

# Import libraries  
import numpy as np  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  

# Generate sample data  
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10  # Independent variable  
y = 3.5 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 2  # Dependent variable  

# Split data into training and testing sets  
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)  

# Fit the model  
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  

# Predict and visualize  
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)  
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='blue', label='Actual')  
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='red', label='Predicted')  
plt.xlabel('X')  
plt.ylabel('y')  
plt.legend()  
plt.show()  

# Print coefficients  
print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_[0]}, Slope: {model.coef_[0][0]}")  

Key Takeaway
Linear Regression is the perfect starting point for understanding machine learning models. While itâ€™s simple, its insights are foundational for building more complex models.
