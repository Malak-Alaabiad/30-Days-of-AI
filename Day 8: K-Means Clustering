ðŸš€ Day 8: K-Means Clustering â€“ Grouping Data Intelligently
Welcome to Day 8 of #30DaysOfMLAlgorithms! Today, weâ€™re diving into K-Means Clustering, a fundamental unsupervised learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters.

Key Concepts
K-Means Clustering is all about organizing data into k distinct groups based on their similarities.

How It Works:

Initialization: Choose k initial cluster centroids randomly.
Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid.
Update: Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all points in a cluster.
Repeat: Perform the assignment and update steps until centroids stabilize or reach a stopping criterion (e.g., maximum iterations).

Key Parameter:
k: The number of clusters to form. Choosing the optimal k often involves techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.

Real-World Applications
Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.
Image Compression: Reducing image size by clustering similar colors.
Anomaly Detection: Identifying data points that donâ€™t belong to any cluster.
Document Clustering: Grouping similar articles, news, or documents.
Genomics: Identifying groups of similar genes or proteins.

Pros and Cons
Pros:

Simple and easy to implement.
Scalable to large datasets.
Works well when clusters are well-separated.
Computationally efficient for low-dimensional data.

Cons:

Sensitive to the choice of k.
Struggles with non-spherical or overlapping clusters.
Can be affected by outliers.
Requires data to be scaled for optimal performance.

Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s how you can implement K-Means Clustering in Python using scikit-learn:

# Import libraries  
import numpy as np  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans  
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs  

# Generate synthetic data  
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.6, random_state=42)  

# Apply K-Means Clustering  
k = 4  # Number of clusters  
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)  
kmeans.fit(X)  

# Get cluster centroids and labels  
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_  
labels = kmeans.labels_  

# Visualize clusters  
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='viridis', s=50)  
plt.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], c='red', marker='X', s=200, label='Centroids')  
plt.title(f'K-Means Clustering (k={k})')  
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')  
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')  
plt.legend()  
plt.show()  

# Predict for new data  
new_data = np.array([[1, 2], [4, 5]])  
predictions = kmeans.predict(new_data)  
print(f"Cluster assignments for new data: {predictions}")  

Key Takeaway
K-Means Clustering is a great tool for discovering hidden patterns in data. While itâ€™s simple and effective, understanding your data and selecting the right 
k are critical for meaningful results.
